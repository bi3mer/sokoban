# Sokoban

This is a reimplementation of [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) with bitboards and [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/).

## Building

You need [ncurses.](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/) On mac, it's pretty easy: `brew install ncurses`. It will also be fairly easy to get ncurses on any Linux distro (e.g., something along the lines of `sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev` if you are on Ubuntu). However, I have no clue how easy or not it will be to install ncurses for Windows or any other OS.

```bash
make
```

## Running

After the game is succesfully built, you can run the game with:

```
./sokoban
```

## Other

Usually, I code a game and I have a repo to document the progress, and that is it. For this project, I went in a different direction and recorded myself while programming the whole thing. You can find the whole series on [YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qzPr5OpPOE&list=PLwaZncztKsRckZ0u3sKbwkZMtH1-ABkDR)
